# Texas-Wind---Turbine---Accuracy-99-
Texas Wind - Turbine About Dataset Problem Statement: The intermittent nature and low control over the wind conditions bring up the same problem to every grid operator in their successful integration to satisfy current demand. In combination with having to predict demand and balance it with the supply, the grid operator now also must predict the availability of wind and solar generation plants in the next hour, day, or week. Apart from holding back the benefits of renewable energy, incorrectly scheduling of wind generation plants may lead to unnecessary reservations, higher costs passed over to the consumer, and use of other more expensive and polluting power resources. Working with real data is challenging due to noise and missing periods.  Dataset details: The provided full-year hourly time-series are simulated using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) software for a location in Texas, US. It has perfect data completeness, and no noisy data; challenges that hinder forecasting tasks with real datasets and distract from the goal. The dataset contains various weather features which can be analyzed and used as predictors.
